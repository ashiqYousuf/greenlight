### Packaging Go Application

1. The go mod tidy command will make sure the go.mod and go.sum files list all the
necessary dependencies for our project (and no unnecessary ones).

2. The go mod verify command will verify that the dependencies stored in your module
cache (located on your machine at $GOPATH/pkg/mod ) match the cryptographic hashes in
the go.sum file.

3. The go mod vendor command will then copy the necessary source code from your
module cache into a new vendor directory in your project root.

4. Now, when you run a command such as go run , go test or go build , the go tool will
recognize the presence of a vendor folder and the dependency code in the vendor folder will
be used â€” rather than the code in the module cache on your local machine.
