when we receive a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, we instruct our server
to stop accepting any new HTTP requests, and give any in-flight requests a ‘grace period’ of 5
seconds to complete before the application is terminated.

CORS:-
The preflight requests always have three components:
the HTTP method OPTIONS , an Origin header, and an Access-Control-Request-Method
header.
